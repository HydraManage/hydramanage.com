<p style="font-size: 38px; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">Why Start Recruiting Early?</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>When I first started my OnlyFans agency, I thought that sending out tons of DMs would quickly bring in models.</p>
<p>I believed that just a big amount of DMs would do the trick.​</p>
<p></p>
<p>But guess what? Most of those messages went unanswered.</p>
<p>It was frustrating and made me feel like a fool.</p>
<p>I was sending long, boring messages that looked like spam.</p>
<p>This is an awful technique that you will see in a lot of courses promising you to teach you how to grow your agency from 0.​</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then moment you watch the video on recruiting they will just expalin to you how if you send 500 dms per day, 30 days a month, you will reach 15 000 models and at least 1% will answer which is about 150 people.​</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sure, I am not saying that by doing this you will not get answers, you will absolutely will, but there are way more effective stragegies out there to get a much higher respons rate.​​​</p>
<p></p>
<p>However it is still difficult to find a model who will actually show up to the meeting and will actually sing with you. So from those 15 000, if 150 answer, there is a high chance that only a couple of those 150 who ansewr will be wroth working with in the long-run.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If I knew this when I was starting out I would have tried to recruit modles much before I even had a contract, a sales letter, or a website and I would have spent time creating those while searching for a model.</p>
<p>Starting early would have saved me a lot of time and headaches later on.</p>
<p>Instead of waiting until everything was perfect, I should have been building my team from the beginning.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>​​​Building Momentum Before Launch​</i></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Starting recruitment early helps you build excitement around your agency.</p>
<p>When models see that you're actively recruiting, they feel more confident in your agency.</p>
<p>For example, having a list of interested models ready makes your agency look established and trustworthy.</p>
<p>This attracts even more models and clients when you officially launch.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>Refining My Recruitment Process​</i></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Recruiting early gave me the chance to improve my methods.</p>
<p>I could try different ways of reaching out and see what worked best.</p>
<p>I learned that shorter, personalized messages get better responses than long, generic ones.</p>
<p>This made my recruitment process more efficient and effective.​</p>
<p></p>
<p>​​</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>Creating a Professional Online Presence​</i></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Before reaching out to models, I needed to make my Instagram look professional.</p>
<p>I spent time making sure my personal Instagram had a clear profile picture and a good bio.</p>
<p>Then, I created a separate business Instagram account for my agency.</p>
<p>Instead of posting random model pictures, I uploaded nine images that formed a bigger picture showing my agency’s message.</p>
<p>This made my profile look organized and attractive, helping me stand out from other agencies.​</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>Enhancing Trust and Credibility​</i></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Early recruitment helped me build trust with potential models.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When models see that you're serious about recruiting and have a structured approach, they trust you more.</p>
<p>I shared stories of success from other models I worked with, even if they were from past experiences.</p>
<p>This made my agency seem reliable and effective, attracting more models who wanted to join a trustworthy team.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>Creating a Pipeline of Talent​</i></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Having a group of models ready before launching ensures a smooth start.</p>
<p>I didn’t have to rush to find models once everything was set up.</p>
<p>Instead, I could focus on supporting and managing the models I already had.</p>
<p>This also gave me a variety of models, catering to different niches and preferences, which made my agency more versatile.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>​</p>
<p style="font-size: 38px; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">Innovative Strategies for Early Recruitment</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>After facing initial struggles, I knew I had to change my approach.</p>
<p>Here are the strategies that really worked for me when I started recruiting early.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>1. Leveraging Storytelling in Outreach</i></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>At first, my DMs were plain and boring.</p>
<p>No one was interested because the messages felt impersonal.</p>
<p>I started telling stories instead of just listing what my agency offers.</p>
<p>Example: "Hey [Name], I wanted to share how Hydra Management Limited helped [Model’s Name] increase her earnings by 30%. Imagine what we could achieve together!"</p>
<p>This made my messages more interesting and relatable, getting more responses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>2. Using Psychological Triggers</i></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>I began using simple psychological tricks to make my messages more effective.</p>
<p>Scarcity: "We have limited spots available for our exclusive models this month."</p>
<p>Social Proof: "Join our community of successful creators and take your OnlyFans career to the next level!"</p>
<p>These tricks made models feel like they needed to act fast and trust that others were already benefiting from my agency.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>3. Creating Interactive Content</i></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>I didn’t just send messages; I engaged with models on Instagram.</p>
<p>I started hosting live Q&A sessions where I talked about common challenges OnlyFans models face and how my agency can help.</p>
<p>This not only built trust but also attracted models who saw the value in my support and expertise.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>4. Personalized Follow-Ups</i></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Instead of sending the same follow-up to everyone, I personalized each message.</p>
<p>Example: "Hi [Name], I noticed you’re into fitness content. We specialize in promoting fitness models and can help you reach a wider audience. Let’s chat!"</p>
<p>Personalized messages showed that I cared about their specific needs, making them more likely to respond positively.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>5. Starting a Value-Driven Blog</i></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Even before my website was ready, I started writing blog posts with useful tips for OnlyFans models.</p>
<p>Sharing these on Instagram made my agency look knowledgeable and helpful, attracting models who wanted professional guidance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>6. Networking with Influencers</i></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>I reached out to influencers in the OnlyFans community to help spread the word about my agency.</p>
<p>We did joint live sessions and interviews where they shared their positive experiences working with me.</p>
<p>This boosted my agency’s visibility and credibility, attracting more models who trusted the influencers’ recommendations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>7. Using Advanced Analytics</i></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>I started using simple analytics tools to see which outreach methods worked best.</p>
<p>By tracking responses, I learned which messages got the most interest.</p>
<p>This helped me focus on the strategies that were most effective, making my recruitment efforts more efficient.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>8. Offering Exclusive Pre-Launch Benefits</i></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>To encourage early sign-ups, I offered special benefits to models who joined before the official launch.</p>
<p>Example: "Join Hydra Management Limited early and get a 10% discount on your first three months!"</p>
<p>These exclusive offers made my agency more attractive and motivated models to join early.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>9. Implementing a Referral Program</i></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>I asked my initial recruits to refer other models by offering them bonuses.</p>
<p>Example: "Refer a friend to Hydra Management Limited and receive a 10% bonus on your next month’s earnings for each successful sign-up."</p>
<p>This helped me grow my model base organically, saving money on recruitment costs and expanding my reach through word-of-mouth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>​</p>
<p style="font-size: 38px; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">How would I have started an agency now</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Let me share an example of how recruiting early can help with the success of any agency. I will go step by step as if I am doing it for the first time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Scenario: Launching with a Strong Foundation</u></p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Action Steps:</i></p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>1. Optimizing Instagram Profiles:</i></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>I will make sure my personal Instagram look professional with a clear profile picture and a strong bio.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I will create a separate business Instagram account for my agency. Instead of random model photos, I will upload nine images that formed a bigger picture showing my agency’s mission. Try to keep that no longer than four to five words.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>2. Engaging with Potential Models:</i></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>I will not sending long, boring DMs anymore. Instead, I will personalize each message with the model’s name and asking her if she is represented by any agency.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Example: "Hi [Name]. I have stumbled accross your onlyfans and I was wondering if you are represented by an agency already?"</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>3. Networking with Influencers:</i></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>I will collaborat with other agency owneres.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In that collaboration I will aim for their endorsement to boosted my agency’s credibility so I can attract more models.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>4. Implementing Innovative Strategies:</i></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>I will use psychological triggers in my messages and started storytelling in my outreach.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Example: "We have limited spots available for our exclusive models this month."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Don't make this sound too exclusive or it will turn the models away.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>5. Offering Exclusive Pre-Launch Benefits:</i></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>I will provid early recruits with discounted commission rates and personalized coaching. This will show them that you are eagered to succeed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, this made my agency ,much more attractive and encouraged models to join early. However, you do not get to that step until the meeting, where you close the model. </p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>6. Implementing a Referral Program:</i></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>After I have worked with the model/s a bit I can offer them refferal.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Example: "Refer a friend to Hydra Management Limited and get a 20% bonus on your next month’s earnings!"</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, this refereal is not much needed as some of the girls will tell their friends how much money she is making, and if you are a person of value who has treated her correctly while she was in the agancy, there is a very high chance she will recommend you to firends of her who show interest.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>Outcome:</i></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>By the time I launch my agency, I will most probaly have at least one model would would be willing to work with me.</p>
<p>This is why early recruitment is of utmost imoprtance!</p>
