<p style="font-size: 38px; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">​The idea struck me</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, I watched an Youtube video where an agency owner was going over a discustion he recently had with a student of his.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The student was being arrogant, refusing to accept the fact that Onlyfans Management is far from an easy business.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, the agency owner decided not to try and convince him anything but rather to give him the opportunity to see for himself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He decided to allow the guy to try and manage one of his model's accounts for a day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even though it was only for a day, I believe this oppportunity changed the student's view towards management businesses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He could not hanlde the fast paced environment and could not do much, thank god he did not have access to chat with the models.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was an interesting video and it got me thinking. I wondered what will be the fastest way of teaching a complete beginner how to set up an agnecy and run it properly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a few days I had a fully developed plan, based on my experience so far.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It contains beginner spets on how to start an agency from the gournd up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And now we are here.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You are reading my blog and I am trying to help you out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is beneficial to you as I will give you some true insights into this business.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is beneficial to me as bigger agency owners can see what I am good at and contact me to work with them to exchange knowledge.</p>
<p>It is a win-win situation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So the question that I initially formed in my head was: "What if I had to hand over a brand-new agency to a complete beginner?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>That single question pushed me into a deep reflection on what it really takes to run a profitable OnlyFans agency.</p>
<p>I stayed up late for several nights jotting down every lesson I’ve learned from messing up, from succeeding, and from watching dozens of other owners crash and burn.</p>
<p>What you’re about to read is my own personal approach—my best attempt at distilling the entire process of building, scaling, and maintaining an OnlyFans agency.</p>
<p>No secret code words, no fancy membership groups, just my experience told in a blunt, no-nonsense way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>​</p>
<p style="font-size: 38px; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">No Two Agencies Are Alike, But the Challenges Are Universal</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>I’ve realized over time that the main difference between a successful and a struggling agency usually comes down to systems and willingness to adapt.</p>
<p>You can have unlimited funds or a roster of unbelievably gorgeous models, but if you have no structure, it’s game over.</p>
<p>Even more importantly, if you aren’t prepared for the constant wave of changes in social media rules, platform bans, models just literally canceling on you in the last possible human second, or the insane quickly shifting market demands, you’ll find yourself drowning bad.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And let’s not forget another major key: You need to recruit and manage your team before you’re “100% ready.”</p>
<p>I used to wait until everything was perfect before bringing on new models.</p>
<p>Biggest mistake ever.</p>
<p>By the time I had all my ducks in a row, I realized I had missed huge opportunities to sign motivated talent who had already run off to someone else.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So if you want to get started, my advice is simple: start recruiting now.</p>
<p>Recruitment, in my opinion, is where the real story begins.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>​</p>
<p style="font-size: 38px; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">Why Recruiting Early Matters (and How I Learned that the Hard Way)</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>I’ll never forget an early moment when I was swamped trying to figure out social media growth hacks, chatting scripts, and pricing models.</p>
<p>I kept telling myself, “I’ll get to recruiting once everything else is finished.”</p>
<p>I was basically trying to perfect the entire business in a vacuum, with no actual creators to give me real feedback.</p>
<p>Result?</p>
<p>I ended up with a bunch of fancy spreadsheets and zero models to manage.</p>
<p>It took a few humiliating months of flipping back and forth before I realized that you learn faster with actual creators on board, even if your systems are still half-built.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s what I discovered:</p>
<p></p>
<p>You refine your onboarding process by actually onboarding models</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your first recruits give you feedback on what works and what doesn’t</p>
<p></p>
<p>Early models can become loyal brand ambassadors if they feel involved from day one</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once I started recruiting, I learned more in a few weeks than I had in the previous months of “theoretical planning.”</p>
<p>That initial wave of mistakes paved the way for better contracts, better communication, and a more streamlined approach overall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>​</p>
<p style="font-size: 38px; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">My Three Building Blocks of Running an OF Agency (And the Invisible “Canopy”)</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>After a good amount of trial and error, I realized the operation basically splits into three big chunks:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Recruiting</p>
<p></p>
<p>Driving Traffic to your model</p>
<p></p>
<p>Chatting with the fans (also known as your chatting department)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Those three building blocks keep everything standing, but they’re held together by a larger, overarching skill: Management.</p>
<p>I like to picture it as a canopy protecting these three areas from total disaster.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why a canopy?</p>
<p>Because if you can’t manage your people—your creators, your virtual assistants, your chatters—none of the other stuff matters.</p>
<p>No matter how genius your growth strategy is, if your communication sucks, your agency crumbles.</p>
<p>And guess who gets blamed?</p>
<p>Exactly: you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>​</p>
<p style="font-size: 38px; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">Building Block #1: Recruiting (Attracting Models Before Your Agency Is “Ready”)</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>“Should I wait until I’m 100% set up before I reach out to models?”</p>
<p>My short answer: No.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I used to be super paranoid about reaching out to models before I had a fancy website or a perfect pitch deck.</p>
<p>Then I realized something interesting:</p>
<p>When you’re early and honest about the fact that you’re building from the ground up, you attract people who want to grow with you.</p>
<p>They feel like partners rather than random employees.</p>
<p>That sense of partnership keeps them invested long-term.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But how do you reach them?</p>
<p>I typically focus on four main methods, each with its own quirks:</p>
<p></p>
<p>In-Person</p>
<p></p>
<p>You meet creators through personal connections, clubs, or local events.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In-person signings usually lead to stronger trust.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But if you don’t live in a big city, you might run out of options fast.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cold DMs</p>
<p></p>
<p>Set up a professional social media page for your agency.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Send out direct messages to potential creators.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yes, you’ll get ignored a lot, but it’s a volume game.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The big advantage?</p>
<p>You can target specific regions or niches.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Paid Ads</p>
<p></p>
<p>If done cleverly, you can automate a lot of the lead generation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The downside is that you get a lot of unqualified or irrelevant applicants.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also, ads can be banned or flagged if you’re too explicit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In my experience, you better have a strong budget and a good funnel if you want real success here.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Model Directories or Marketplaces</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some third-party services compile a list of models actively looking for representation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Saves you time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Often costs money, and sometimes you still have to deal with creators who bail last minute.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Early on, I leaned heavily on cold DMs.</p>
<p>I learned how to design a killer agency profile, paid a few actresses for testimonials, and crafted personalized messaging that actually got replies.</p>
<p>But it was slow going at first, and I had to train a team of virtual assistants to help me send those messages in high volumes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’ve messed up plenty, like sending the same generic script to hundreds of people who had no interest in OnlyFans.</p>
<p>I ended up refining the entire approach to personalize each message, mention something specific about them, and then lead them into a short but warm conversation.</p>
<p>Once they showed genuine curiosity, I’d schedule a quick Zoom call where I’d pitch the entire plan.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My personal tip: Don’t rely on just one method.</p>
<p>Mix it up.</p>
<p>Try a bit of in-person if possible, sprinkle in some paid ads, and keep your eyes on reputable model marketplaces.</p>
<p>By diversifying, you give yourself a safety net.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>​</p>
<p style="font-size: 38px; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">Building Block #2: Driving Traffic (A.K.A. The Art of Getting Attention)</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Once your models are on board, the next puzzle is: How do you get more subscribers?</p>
<p>I realized traffic is mostly about two core strategies in my agency:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Spreading Viral Content</p>
<p></p>
<p>Leveraging Dating Apps</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are more ways, of course—some people run influencer collaborations or build entire brand channels on multiple platforms.</p>
<p>But these two continue to blow my mind with how consistently they bring in results.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">The Burner-Content Method</p>
<p>Burner content is what I call “super-edgy posts” that might break or bend the rules on certain platforms.</p>
<p>Short clips that push the line, using shock tactics to get massive views.</p>
<p>Expect accounts to get flagged eventually, but you can just replace them with new ones.</p>
<p>A lot of agencies do this because, quite frankly, it works.</p>
<p>People love a little risk, and the payoff is usually quick hits of viral success.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But be warned:</p>
<p>It takes some organization to maintain multiple backup profiles, especially if they get banned at random times.</p>
<p>You’ll need a system where you constantly re-upload content to new accounts without skipping a beat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">Building a Personal Brand</p>
<p>If burner content is the wild, high-risk approach, brand-based content is more slow and steady.</p>
<p>Here, your models pick something they genuinely care about—anything from yoga to makeup to eSports—and create content that resonates with folks who share that interest.</p>
<p>Platforms like short-form video apps and Instagram Reels push these niche-focused videos out to potential fans.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Brand content won’t typically explode overnight, but it’s sustainable.</p>
<p>Eventually, you’ll see subscribers who feel a deeper emotional connection to the model—beyond just attraction.</p>
<p>These subs tend to spend more and stick around longer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why I Love Mixing the Two</p>
<p>I prefer to let my creators test both.</p>
<p>When they see a viral spike from edgy content, it motivates them to keep going.</p>
<p>But I also encourage them to invest in something they’re passionate about, so they build a stable, loyal following.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">Dating Apps: The Undisputed Traffic Champion</p>
<p>It might sound odd, but dating apps are gold mines.</p>
<p>When I realized just how many messages an attractive profile could generate on these platforms, I was floored.</p>
<p>Not only do you get to precisely target a location, but the men who swipe right truly believe they might get to meet the creator in person.</p>
<p>This fantasy often leads to spending sprees once they subscribe to her page.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But make no mistake:</p>
<p>Maintaining dozens of phone-verified accounts, dealing with daily bans, and scaling across different cities is a technical nightmare if you’re unprepared.</p>
<p>I learned early on to partner with people who specialize in this.</p>
<p>I prefer to pay experts who already know how to keep these accounts from getting shut down.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>​</p>
<p style="font-size: 38px; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">Buliding Block #3: Selling Premium Content (Chatting and Upselling)</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>We can talk all day about recruiters and traffic experts, but if you aren’t effectively selling once fans arrive, you’re missing the big money.</p>
<p>That’s where a strong team of chatters comes in.</p>
<p>They’re the folks who keep the conversation rolling, who build relationships with fans, and who suggest upsells at the perfect moment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A rookie mistake I made was hiring random people for chatting without proper scripts.</p>
<p>I assumed they’d figure it out on their own.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Some used awkward lines, some forgot to stay consistent with the model’s “personality,” and some just spammed repetitive messages that turned fans off.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, I sat down and wrote out a structured flow:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Greeting</p>
<p></p>
<p>Discovery (find out about the fan’s interests)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Teasing (offer free glimpses of content)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Upselling (turn casual chatters into paying customers)</p>
<p></p>
<p>After a few weeks, the difference in revenue was huge.</p>
<p>My chatters had direction, and the fans felt a more personal connection.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>​</p>
<p style="font-size: 38px; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">The Canopy: Management</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Now, imagine you’ve got your three pillars:</p>
<p></p>
<p>A lively recruitment pipeline</p>
<p></p>
<p>A traffic engine pumping new fans in</p>
<p></p>
<p>A sales team chat-selling content like there’s no tomorrow</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why do some agencies still collapse?</p>
<p>Because they ignore management.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s what I mean by management:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Creating standardized onboarding for every new model and every new staff member</p>
<p></p>
<p>Offering daily check-ins (like pep talks or short Zoom calls) to keep motivation high</p>
<p></p>
<p>Drafting crystal-clear contracts so each creator knows exactly what’s expected</p>
<p></p>
<p>Using a gentle but firm approach when creators stop putting in effort</p>
<p></p>
<p>Setting mini-goals to show progress and keep everyone excited</p>
<p></p>
<p>Early on, I had no idea how to handle these tasks.</p>
<p>I ended up in situations where creators would ghost me for days, or new hires would claim confusion about my instructions.</p>
<p>I learned to adopt a method I like to call the “feedback sandwich”: start with something positive, slip in the constructive criticism, end with some encouraging words.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I also discovered you can’t half-heartedly manage.</p>
<p>When a creator is frustrated because a video flopped, you’ve got to address that emotional dip.</p>
<p>When a chatter starts slacking, you have to show them how to improve or replace them if they won’t fix it.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s time-consuming, but it’s also the glue that holds everything together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>​</p>
<p style="font-size: 38px; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">My Personal Breakdown: Costs, Compensation, and Team Setup</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>In my case, I keep it simple and fair.</p>
<p>I usually split my deals with models in a way that incentivizes them to produce high-quality content while still paying me for all the overhead (traffic, chatters, ads, etc.).</p>
<p>I never lock them into something that feels predatory, but I do make it clear that their responsibilities are non-negotiable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’ve messed up by over-promising to certain models, giving them extremely high revenue shares, only to find out they didn’t want to put in any real effort.</p>
<p>So now I carefully assess each potential recruit:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Are they excited to do daily social media?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Do they speak decent English?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Will they respond quickly to my messages?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Can they handle negative comments or is that going to ruin their day?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once I trust they’ll do the work, I bring them on.</p>
<p>I maintain a small but nimble group of chatters who work on commission, plus a handful of virtual assistants paid a base wage to do grunt tasks like editing videos, uploading content, and scheduling.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>​</p>
<p style="font-size: 38px; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">A recent story I had: The Model Who Turned Doubt into Dollars</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>One of my proudest moments was with a creator I’ll call “Ellie.”</p>
<p>She had some Instagram followers, but no experience monetizing them.</p>
<p>She was nervous about the hate she might get from family and friends.</p>
<p>Still, she plunged in.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">Week One:</p>
<p>She recorded a batch of quick, edgy clips for short-form videos.</p>
<p>We uploaded them to a few disposable accounts.</p>
<p>One or two clips got a modest boost, which was enough to bring in a handful of new subscribers.</p>
<p>Just enough to prove the concept.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">Week Two:</p>
<p>She started exploring her passion for cosplay.</p>
<p>We created a brand angle for her so she’d stand out.</p>
<p>She posted about her costume-making, small behind-the-scenes glances into her makeup routine, and interactive stories where fans voted on her next cosplay theme.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">Week Three:</p>
<p>She started seeing bigger spikes in engagement, especially when she teased special outfit reveals on her subscription page.</p>
<p>Our chatters also had a field day selling private photos of her different costumes.</p>
<p>It was a perfect mix of playful and steamy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After about a short time, Ellie was hooked.</p>
<p>She told me she loved creating this style of content, and her fans were spending big because they truly connected with her personality.</p>
<p>She also realized how critical it was that we had started early on her recruitment and marketing.</p>
<p>By the time the bigger strategies were in place, she already had a loyal base that helped boost her confidence and income.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>​</p>
<p style="font-size: 38px; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">Wrapping It All Up</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Running a successful OnlyFans agency isn’t for the faint-hearted.</p>
<p>There are endless moving parts: from chasing down new recruits to analyzing why a certain post got deleted for violating guidelines.</p>
<p>However, I’ve found there’s an incredible payoff—both financially and personally—if you’re willing to persist through the chaos.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s what I’ve learned in a nutshell:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Don’t wait until you feel ready to start recruiting; do it early and refine on the go.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cold DMs, in-person meets, ads, and marketplaces all play a role. Mix them up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Viral traffic can come from edgy “burner” content or from well-planned brand-based content.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dating apps can be insanely profitable if you can handle the technical setup (or hire experts who can).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Chatting is the make-or-break factor for turning random fans into paying customers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Management ties everything together. A supportive yet strict approach keeps your team and your creators motivated.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Contracts matter, but personal buy-in from models matters more.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Scale strategically. Don’t jump to 20 models if you can’t handle the chaos of even five.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Keep personal anecdotes alive. They help you pivot faster when you make mistakes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Embrace a bit of chaos—the industry changes at a moment’s notice, so staying flexible will save your sanity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>​</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">My biggest takeaway?</p>
<p>You don’t need a decade of experience to start seeing real results.</p>
<p>What you need is the right mix of hustle, an adaptable system, and a knack for guiding people through the highs and lows.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, if you’re reading this and thinking about launching your own agency—or revamping the one you already have—my advice is straightforward: get into the trenches, start messy, and learn from every misstep.</p>
<p>There’s no perfect blueprint, but if you keep your three pillars strong and look after them with solid management, you’ll build something truly unstoppable.</p>
